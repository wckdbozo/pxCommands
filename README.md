# pxCommands

A modular chat and command system for FiveM supporting ESX, QBCore, QBox, and standalone servers.

## Features

- Framework agnostic with explicit configuration
- Modular architecture (commands, modules, system)
- Event namespace (`pxc:*`)
- Server-side security enforcement
- Automatic command help and suggestions
- Range-based proximity messaging

## Quick Start

1. Place `pxCommands` in your resources folder
2. Add `ensure pxCommands` to `server.cfg`
3. Edit `system/config.lua` with your framework:
   ```lua
   Config.Framework = 'esx'  -- or 'qbcore', 'qbox', 'standalone'
   ```
4. Create command packs in `commands/` folder

## Command Packs

Create `.lua` files in `commands/`:

```lua
CommandPack("MyPack", "AuthorName", {
    {
        command = "hello",
        format = "#name# says hello!",
        help = "Say hello",
    },
})
```
