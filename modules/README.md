# Modules

Optional client-side modules. Add or remove module files here; they are auto-loaded via the `modules/cl_*.lua` pattern in the fxmanifest.

Current modules:
- `cl_overhead_text.lua` — renders floating text above player heads when triggered by the `pxc:showFloatingText` event (**NOTE:** as of Artifact `25718` there is ongoing issues displaying text above players, CFX is working on a fix)
